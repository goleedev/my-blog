# Goeun Lee

> I'm a software engineer interested in communications/working with people💁 around the world!

My focus area for now is front-end development with React and back-end development with Node. Frankly speaking, I love learning new things in terms of programming. In addition to that, I am very quality-conscious because I spent my early career years in research roles. FYI, the research was about chatbot service in the US.
